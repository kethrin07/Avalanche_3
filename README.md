# Create and Mint Token

In Remix, after deploying your ERC20 token contract, you use the deployed contract dropdown to select it, then interact via function buttons to mint, burn, transfer tokens, or read balances, confirming transactions through MetaMask for each action.

## Description

In Remix, once you've compiled and deployed your ERC20 token contract, you interact with it using the deployed contracts dropdown menu, selecting your contract to access its functions. Within the "Interact with Contract" section, you can perform actions like minting new tokens, burning existing tokens, transferring tokens between addresses, and querying balances. Each action requires confirmation through MetaMask or a similar Web3 provider, ensuring secure and transparent transaction execution. The interface also provides details such as the contract's deployment address and options to select the Solidity compiler version used for deployment and interaction. This setup in Remix enables efficient management and testing of ERC20 token functionalities directly from your browser.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

In Remix, after compiling and deploying your ERC20 token contract, you execute it by selecting the contract from the deployed contracts dropdown. You then interact with its functions such as minting, burning, transferring tokens, and querying balances using the provided interface. Each interaction involves entering necessary parameters, confirming actions through MetaMask, and monitoring transaction status and logs for validation and debugging purposes. This process allows for comprehensive testing and management of your ERC20 token's functionalities directly within the Remix IDE.
